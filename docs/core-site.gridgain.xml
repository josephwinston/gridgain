<!--
    This template file contains settings needed to run Apache Hadoop jobs
    with GridGain's distributed in-memory file system GGFS.

    You can replace '$HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml' file with this one
    to work with GridGain GGFS nodes running on localhost (these local nodes can be
    a part of distributed cluster though). To work with file system on remote
    hosts you need to change the host of file system URI to any host running
    GridGain's GGFS node.

    Note that GridGain jars must be in Apache Hadoop client classpath to work
    with this configuration.

    Run script '$GRIDGAIN_HOME/bin/setup-hadoop.{sh|bat}' for Apache Hadoop client setup.
